/**
 * Is an iterable reader of bytes from a channel.<p>
 * 
 * The characteristics of this class are covered well by the JavaDoc of
 * {@link Request.Body}, who is just one of many that will over time iterate
 * bytes from this reader (i.e., the underlying child channel). Prior to the
 * request body, there will be two parsers respectively for the request line and
 * headers. Following the body there may be a parser of request trailers.<p>
 * 
 * Parsers and body decoders ought to know when they have reached their
 * respective delimiter. For a body of a known length, the method
 * {@link #limit(long) limit} must be used to cap the reader.<p>
 * 
 * The reader must be invalidated at the end of the HTTP exchange by calling the
 * method {@link #dismiss() dismiss}. This class self-dismisses on channel
 * failure and on an unexpected end-of-stream.
