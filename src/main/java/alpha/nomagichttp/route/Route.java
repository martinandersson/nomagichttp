/**
 * A {@code Route} is "a target resource upon which to apply semantics"
 * (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.1">RFC 7230 ยง5.1</a>).
 * It can be built using a {@link #builder(String)}. There's also a convenient
 * shortcut which both builds and add the route; {@link
 * HttpServer#add(String, RequestHandler, RequestHandler...)}.<p>
 * 
 * The route is associated with one or more <i>request handlers</i>. In HTTP
 * parlance, handlers are also known as different "representations" of the
 * resource. Which handler specifically to invoke for the request is determined
 * by qualifying metadata and specificity, as detailed in the Javadoc of {@link
 * RequestHandler}.<p>
 * 
 * A request will match exactly one or no route in the {@link RouteRegistry}
 * held by the HTTP server. Your users will not suffer from unintended surprises
 * and there are no complex and hard to understand priority rules to learn.
 * Attempting to add a route to a route registry which already has an
 * equivalent route registered will throw a {@link RouteCollisionException}.<p>
 * 
 * An example of a request (copy-pasted from
 * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.3.1">RFC 7230 ยง5.3.1</a>):
 * <pre>{@code
 *   GET /where?q=now HTTP/1.1
 *   Host: www.example.com
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * The request-target "/where?q=now" has a path component and a query component.
 * The path "/where" will match a route which declares exactly one segment
 * "where". The query "?q=now" specifies a "q"-named parameter with the value
 * "now".<p>
 * 
 * The route may declare named path parameters which act like a wildcard segment
 * whose dynamic value is given by the client through the request path. Path-
 * and query parameters may be retrieved using {@link Request#parameters()}<p>
 * 
 * Path parameters come in two forms; single-segment and catch-all.<p>
 * 
 * Single-segment path parameters match anything until the next '/' or the path
 * end. They are denoted using the prefix ':'. A request path must carry a value
 * for the segment in order to match with a route that has declared a
 * single-segment path parameter. They can not be configured as optional.
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   Route registered: /user/:id
 *   
 *   Request path:
 *   /user/123            match, id = 123
 *   /user/foo            match, id = foo
 *   /user                no match (missing segment value)
 *   /user/foo/profile    no match (unknown segment "profile")
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Within the route registry, path parameters (both single-segment and
 * catch-all) are mutually exclusive for that segment position. For example, you
 * can not at the same time register a route {@code "/user/new"} and a route
 * {@code "/user/:id"}, or {@code "/user/:id"} and {@code "/user/:blabla"}.<p>
 * 
 * Static- and single segment path parameters may have any number of descendant
 * routes on the same hierarchical branch. In the following example, we register
 * three different routes in order to better guide the client:
 * <pre>
 *   /user                   respond "404 Bad Request, missing id"
 *   /user/:id               respond options available for the user, "file, ..."
 *   /user/:uid/file/:fid    respond specified user file
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The previous example also demonstrates that just because two or more routes
 * are located on the same hierarchical branch, the path parameter names they
 * declare may still be different. A path parameter name is only required to be
 * unique for a specific {@code Route} object. The last route could have just as
 * well been expressed as {@code "/user/:id/file/:fid"} and added to the same
 * registry. But, this route can never be constructed: {@code
 * "/user/:id/file/:id"} (duplicated name!)<p> 
 * 
 * Catch-all path parameters match everything until the path end. They must
 * therefore be the last segment defined. They are denoted using the prefix
 * '*'.<p>
 * 
 * Catch-all parameters are effectively optional since they match everything
 * from a given position, including nothing at all. For consistency, the
 * value when retrieved will always begin with a '/', even if the client didn't
 * provide a value in the request path. On the contrary, single-segment
 * parameter values will never begin with '/' as these are truncated from the
 * request path (see the subsequently documented normalization procedure).
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   Route registered: /src/*filepath
 * 
 *   /src                    match, filepath = "/"
 *   /src/                   match, filepath = "/"
 *   /src/subdir             match, filepath = "/subdir"
 *   /src/subdir/file.txt    match, filepath = "/subdir/file.txt"
 * </pre>
 *
 * It is possible to mix both parameter styles, e.g. {@code
 * "/:drive/*filepath"}.<p>
 * 
 * As previously noted, static- and single segment parameters can build a route
 * hierarchy. Or in other words, a route position may have a parent route. For
 * example, you can have {@code "/user"}, {@code "/user/:id"} and {@code
 * "/user/:id/avatar"} all registered at the same time in the same registry. But
 * this is not true for catch-all since it matches everything including no value
 * at all. You can not register {@code "/src"} and {@code "/src/*filepath"} in
 * the same registry at the same time. Failure to register a route with the
 * registry causes a {@link RouteCollisionException} to be thrown.<p>
 * 
 * Query parameters are always optional, they can not be used to distinguish one
 * route from another, nor do they affect how a request path is matched against
 * a route.<p>
 * 
 * In order to find a matching route, the following steps are applied to the
 * request path:
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Clustered forward slashes are reduced to just one. Empty segments are
 *       not supported and will consequently be discarded.</li>
 *   <li>All trailing forward slashes are truncated. A trailing slash is usually
 *       used to separate a file from a directory. However, "R" in URI stands
 *       for <i>resource</i>. Be that a file, directory, whatever - makes no
 *       difference.</li>
 *   <li>The empty path will be replaced with "/".</li>
 *   <li>The path is split into segments using the forward slash character as a
 *       separator.</li>
 *   <li>Each segment will be percent-decoded as if using {@link
 *       URLDecoder#decode(String, Charset) URLDecoder.decode(segment, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)}
 *       <i>except</i> the plus sign ('+') is <i>not</i> converted to a space
 *       character and remains the same (standard
 *       <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1">RFC 3986</a> behavior).</li>
 *   <li>Dot-segments (".", "..") are normalized as defined by step 1 and 2 in
 *       Javadoc of {@link URI#normalize()} (basically "." is removed and ".."
 *       removes the previous segment, also see <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-9.1">
 *       RFC 7231 ยง9.1</a>)</li>
 *   <li>Finally, all remaining segments that are not interpreted as a path
 *       parameter value must match a route's segments exactly and in order. In
 *       particular, note that route-matching is case-sensitive and characters
 *       such as "+" and "*" has no special meaning, they will be compared
 *       literally.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * The implementation is thread-safe and immutable. It does not necessarily
 * implement {@code hashCode()} and {@code equals()}.

     * The most simplest route that can be built is the root without path

     * each element will be consumed as either a static segment or a path
     * parameter name. The pattern is a shortcut for using explicit builder
     * methods to accomplish the same result. All of these expressions builds a
     * route of the same path ({@code "/files/:user/*filepath"}):
