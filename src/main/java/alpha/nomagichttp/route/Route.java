/**
 * A {@code Route} is "a target resource upon which to apply semantics"
 * (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.1">RFC 7230 ยง5.1</a>).
 * It can be built using a {@link #builder()} or other static methods found in
 * {@link Routes}.<p>
 * 
 * The route is associated with one or more <i>request handlers</i>. In HTTP
 * parlance, handlers are also known as different "representations" of the
 * resource. Which handler specifically to invoke for the request is determined
 * by qualifying metadata and specificity, as detailed in the javadoc of {@link
 * RequestHandler}.<p>
 * 
 * Suppose the HTTP server receives this request (
 * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.3.1">RFC 7230 ยง5.3.1</a>):<p>
 * <pre>{@code
 *   GET /where?q=now HTTP/1.1
 *   Host: www.example.com
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * The request-target "/where?q=now" has a <i>path</i> component and a query
 * component. The path "/where" will match a route in the HTTP server with the
 * same identity. The query "?q=now" specifies one "q"-named parameter with
 * value "now". The value can be retrieved using {@link
 * Request#paramFromQuery(String)}.<p>
 * 
 * The route may declare named path parameters that acts like a dynamic
 * segment whose value is given by the client through the path and retrievable
 * using {@link Request#paramFromPath(String) request}.<p>
 * 
 * Both query- and path parameters are optional and they can not be specified
 * as required. The request handler is free to interpret the presence, absence
 * and value of parameters however it sees fit. A path parameter value will be
 * assumed to end with a space- or forward slash character ('/').<p>
 * 
 * The route identity starts with a forward slash and consists of all its
 * segments joined without path parameter names. For example - using curly
 * braces ("{}") syntax for notation purposes only - this route:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   /users/{user-id}/items/{item-id}
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Has identity {@code "/users/items"}. It will become the match for all of the
 * following request paths:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   /users/items
 *   /users/123/items
 *   /users/items/456
 *   /users/123/items/456
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The only difference being whether or not parameter values are present in the
 * request object.<p>
 * 
 * Route collision- and ambiguity is detected at build-time and will fail-fast.
 * For example, the route {@code "/where/{param}"} can not be added to an HTTP
 * server which already has {@code "/where"} registered. This would crash with a
 * {@link RouteCollisionException}. TODO: Add ref to AmbiguousRouteCollisionException<p>
 * 
 * The implementation is thread-safe.
