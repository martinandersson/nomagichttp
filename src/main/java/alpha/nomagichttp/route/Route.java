/**
 * A {@code Route} represents the request-target from a request-line of an URI
 * coupled together with one or many request handlers that knows how to process
 * the request.<p>
 *
 * The request-target is also known as "a target resource upon which to apply
 * [...] semantics", i.e. handlers (
 * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.1">RFC 7230 ยง5.1</a>).<p>
 * 
 * For example, given this request:<p>
 * <pre>{@code
 *   GET /hello.txt HTTP/1.1
 *   User-Agent: curl/7.16.3 libcurl/7.16.3 OpenSSL/0.9.7l zlib/1.2.3
 *   Host: www.example.com
 *   Accept: text/plain;charset=utf-8
 * }</pre>
 *
 * The route "/hello.txt" is the request-target and can only match one
 * registered route for the server. Which one of the route's possibly many
 * handlers to handle the request is determined based on the method token - in
 * this example "GET" - and if present, the "Accept" and "Content-Type" headers.
 * Read more on this in the javadoc of {@linkplain RequestHandler}<p>
 * 
 * Routes are added to a {@link RouteRegistry registry} which is added to the
 * {@link HttpServer server}.<p>
 * 
 * When routing a request, the server will first find the route using {@link
 * RouteRegistry#lookup(String)}, then find the handler using {@link
 * Route#lookup(String, MediaType, MediaType[])}.<p>
 * 
 * The identity of all registered routes correspond to unique paths, or in other
 * words; unique joins of the route segments without taking parameters and
 * handlers into consideration. This means that all parameters in the request
 * are optional and they (or handlers) can not be used to differentiate routes
 * apart. The handler is still free to perform request argument validation and
 * respond accordingly.<p>
 * 
 * The identity-rule has many benefits. It's much more aligned with the HTTP
 * specification which defines a resource to which handlers and parameters are
 * semantics; icing on the cake. It's also a much more simple design and easy to
 * understand versus having to specify how exactly the semantics would
 * participate in the identity. Lastly, it has runtime benefits in the form of a
 * faster lookup (server can assume <i>any</i> match of a request-target is the
 * correct one) and there will be no late surprises in production due to
 * ambiguity (route registry builder fail-fast with a
 * {@link RouteCollisionException}).<p>
 * 
 * The implementation must be thread-safe.
