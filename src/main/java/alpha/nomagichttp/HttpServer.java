/**
 * Listens on a port for HTTP connections.<p>
 * 
 * The server's function is to provide port- and channel management, parse
 * an inbound request head and resolve a handler against a target route (also
 * known as a "server resource") that is qualified to handle the request. The
 * handler has almost total freedom in regards to how it interprets the request
 * headers- and body as well as what headers and body it responds.<p>
 * 
 * The process of receiving a request and respond responses (any number of
 * interim responses, followed by a final response) is often called an
 * "exchange".<p>
 * 
 * This interface declares static <i>{@code create}</i> methods that construct
 * and return the default implementation {@link DefaultServer}. Once the server
 * has been constructed, it needs to <i>{@code start()}</i> which will open the
 * server's listening port.<p>
 * 
 * A trivial example:
 * <pre>
 *   HttpServer.{@link #create(ErrorHandler...) create}()
 *             .{@link #add(String, RequestHandler, RequestHandler...) add
 *                 }("/", {@link RequestHandler#GET()
 *                 GET}().{@link RequestHandler.Builder#apply(Throwing.Function)
 *                 apply}(request -> {@link Responses#text(String)
 *                 text}("Hello")))
 *             .{@link #start(IntConsumer) start}(port ->
 *                 System.out.println("Listening on port: " + port));
 * </pre>
 * 
 * What was <i>added</i> to the server is a {@link RequestHandler} mapped to a
 * {@link Route} pattern. Optionally, one can also register
 * {@link BeforeAction}s that executes before the request handler (both together
 * often called the "request processing chain"), and {@link AfterAction}s that
 * can manipulate responses before they are sent. Exceptions can be handled
 * server-globally using any number of {@link ErrorHandler}s. And there you have
 * it, that's about all the types one needs to get familiar with. No magic.
 * 
 * <h2>Server Life-Cycle</h2>
 * 
 * Almost all {@code start} methods block indefinitely, the only exception being
 * is the {@link #startAsync() startAsync} method. None of the start methods
 * create a platform thread, and all virtual threads created are always
 * non-daemon. Meaning that all opened server ports and client connections are
 * immediately closed (with no grace-period defined) when the application's main
 * thread terminates, unless the application itself created a non-daemon
 * platform thread.<p>
 * 
 * One could register an administrator endpoint to handle a graceful shut down
 * of the server, but the handler would generally be hard to implement as the
 * HTTP protocol has no built-in feature to pause and resume an exchange. What
 * to do if a client is in the middle of streaming data?<p>
 * 
 * Thus, the call to one of the blocking {@code start} methods will likely be
 * one of, if not the last, statement done by the application code; relying on
 * an external process termination to close the server.<p>
 * 
 * TODO: Give example of main method throwing what exactly?
 * <p>
 * 
 * It is possible to start multiple server instances on different ports. One
 * use-case is to expose public endpoints on one port but keep more sensitive
 * administrator endpoints on another more secluded port.
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 *   try (var exec = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
 *       exec.submit(() -> HttpServer.create().start(8080));
 *       exec.submit(() -> HttpServer.create().start(8081));
 *       // Implicit exec.close() will await termination of both servers
 *   }
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * This example also illustrated why all blocking {@code start} methods' return
 * type is declared {@code Void}, as opposed to {@code void}; it is to enable
 * the exception-throwing {@code start} method to be used as a
 * {@code Callable<V>} expression lambda. Otherwise, the example would not have
 * compiled (and the alternative code is very clumsy, to say the least).<p>
 * 
 * A server instance can not be recycled; it can only start and stop once.<p>
 * 
 * Code executing within the server (for example the request handler), and all
 * listeners who registered with {@link #events()}, will be able to retrieve
 * the server instance using {@link ScopedValues#httpServer()}.
 * 
 * <h2>Supported HTTP Versions</h2>
 *
 * Currently, the NoMagicHTTP library is a project in its infancy. Almost
 * complete support for HTTP/1.0 and 1.1 is the first milestone, yet to be done
 * (see POA.md in repository). HTTP/2 will be implemented thereafter. HTTP
 * clients older than HTTP/1.0 is rejected (the exchange will crash with a
 * {@link HttpVersionTooOldException}).
 * 
 * <h2>Thread Safety and Threading Model</h2>
 * 
 * All methods found on the {@code HttpServer} interface are thread-safe.<p>
 * 
 * Many components operated within the HTTP exchange is <i>not</i> thread-safe.
 * And, there's a reason for that. The default server implementation uses one
 * virtual thread per client channel, semantically known as "one thread per
 * request" (technically, one thread for each client connection, which may be
 * used for many consecutive exchanges). This thread will run through the entire
 * request processing chain and also be the one that writes the response.<p>
 * 
 * For the application developer, it is both safe and elegant to write
 * semantically blocking code. If and when a method would have blocked, the
 * virtual thread will unmount from its carrier thread, making the carrier
 * thread available to be mounted by a another virtual thread.<p>
 * 
 * The application should <i>not</i> process the request asynchronously. The
 * library API may throw a {@link WrongThreadException} if called by a platform
 * thread and that call would have caused the thread to block.<p>
 * 
 * TODO: Give bad example of concurrent outbound calls to dependent services
 * using a parallel Stream on native threads.<p>
 * 
 * TODO: Give good example using {@link StructuredTaskScope}.
 * 
 * <h2>HTTP message semantics</h2>
 * 
 * Only a very few message variants are specified to <i>not</i> have a body and
 * will be rejected by the server if they do ({@link
 * IllegalRequestBodyException}, {@link IllegalResponseBodyException}). These
 * variants <i>must</i> be rejected since including a body would likely have
 * killed the protocol.<p>
 * 
 * For all other variants of requests and responses, the body is optional and
 * the server does not reject the message based on the presence (or absence) of
 * a body. This is mostly true for all other message variants as well; the
 * server does not have an opinionated view unless an opinionated view is
 * warranted. The request handler is almost in full control over how it
 * interprets the request message and what response it returns with little
 * interference from the server.<p>
 * 
 * For example, it might not be common but it <i>is</i>
 * allowed for {@link HttpConstants.Method#GET GET} requests (
 * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.1">RFC 7231 ยง4.3.1</a>
 * ) to have a body and for {@link HttpConstants.Method#POST POST} requests to
 * not have a body (
 * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2">RFC 7230 ยง3.3.2</a>
 * ). Similarly, the {@link HttpConstants.StatusCode#TWO_HUNDRED_ONE 201
 * (Created)} response often do have a body which "typically describes and links
 * to the resource(s) created" (
 * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.3.2">RFC 7231 ยง6.3.2</a>
 * ), but it's not required to. And so the list goes on (for more info, see
 * <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/70157919/1268003">this StackOverflow answer</a>).
