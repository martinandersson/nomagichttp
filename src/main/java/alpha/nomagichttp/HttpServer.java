/**
 * Listens on a port for HTTP connections.<p>
 * 
 * The server's function is to provide port- and channel management, parse
 * an inbound request head and resolve a handler within a target route (also
 * known as a "server resource") that is qualified to handle the request. Once
 * the handler has been invoked, it has almost total freedom in regards to how
 * it interprets the request headers- and body as well as what headers and body
 * it responds.<p>
 * 
 * The process of receiving a request and respond responses (any number of
 * intermittent responses, followed by a final response) is often called an
 * "exchange".<p>
 * 
 * This interface declares static <i>{@code create}</i> methods that construct
 * and return the default implementation {@link DefaultServer}. Once the server
 * has been constructed, it needs to <i>{@code start()}</i> which will open the
 * server's listening port.<p>
 * 
 * Routes can be dynamically added and removed using {@link #add(Route)
 * add(Route)} and {@link #remove(Route) remove(Route)}. A legal server variant
 * is to not even have any routes registered. The idea is that resources (what's
 * "behind the route") can be short-lived and serve very specific purposes, so
 * their presence can change.<p>
 * 
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 *   HttpServer.{@link #create(ErrorHandler...)
 *     create}().{@link #add(String, RequestHandler, RequestHandler...)
 *       add}("/", {@link RequestHandler#GET()
 *         GET}().{@link RequestHandler.Builder#respond(Response)
 *           respond}({@link Responses#text(String)
 *             text}("Hello"))).{@link #start() start}();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h2>Server Life-Cycle</h2>
 * 
 * It is possible to start many server instances on different ports. One
 * use-case for this pattern is to expose public endpoints on one port but keep
 * more sensitive administrator endpoints on another more secluded port.<p>
 * 
 * If at least one server is running, then the JVM will not shutdown when the
 * main application thread dies. For the application process to end, all
 * server instances must {@link #stop()}.<p>
 * 
 * The server may be recycled, i.e. started anew after having been stopped, any
 * number of times.
 * 
 * <h2>Supported HTTP Versions</h2>
 *
 * Currently, the NoMagicHTTP server is a project in its infancy. Almost
 * complete support for HTTP/1.0 and 1.1 is the first milestone, yet to be done
 * (see POA.md in repository). HTTP/2 will be implemented thereafter. HTTP
 * clients older than HTTP/1.0 is rejected (the exchange will crash with a
 * {@link HttpVersionTooOldException}).
 * 
 * <h2>HTTP message semantics</h2>
 * 
 * Only a very few message variants are specified to <i>not</i> have a body and
 * will be rejected by the server if they do ({@link
 * IllegalRequestBodyException}, {@link IllegalResponseBodyException}). These
 * variants <i>must</i> be rejected since including a body would have likely
 * killed the protocol.<p>
 * 
 * For all other variants of requests and responses, the body is optional and
 * the server does not reject the message based on the presence of a body. This
 * is mostly true for all other message variants as well; the server does not
 * have an opinionated view unless an opinionated view is warranted. The request
 * handler is mostly in control over how it interprets the request message and
 * what response it returns with no interference.<p>
 * 
 * For example, it might not be common but it <i>is</i>
 * allowed for {@link HttpConstants.Method#GET GET} requests (
 * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.1">RFC 7231 ยง4.3.1</a>
 * ) to have a body and for {@link HttpConstants.Method#POST POST} requests to
 * not have a body (
 * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2">RFC 7230 ยง3.3.2</a>
 * ). Similarly, the {@link HttpConstants.StatusCode#TWO_HUNDRED_ONE 201
 * (Created)} response often do have a body which "typically describes and links
 * to the resource(s) created" (
 * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.3.2">RFC 7231 ยง6.3.2</a>
 * ), but it's not required to. And so the list goes on.
 * 
 * <h2>Thread Safety and Threading Model</h2>
 * 
 * The server is fully thread-safe, and mostly, asynchronous and
 * non-blocking. This is mostly true for the entire library API. It's actually
 * quite hard to screw up when programming with the NoMagicHTTP server.<p>
 * 
 * Life-cycle methods {@code start} and {@code stop} may block temporarily.<p>
 * 
 * The HttpServer API also functions as a route registry, to which we {@code
 * add} and {@code remove} routes. These methods are highly concurrent but may
 * impose minuscule blocks at the discretion of the implementation. Most
 * importantly, looking up a route - as is done on every inbound request - never
 * blocks and features great performance no matter the size of the registry.<p>
 * 
 * All servers running in the same JVM share a common pool of threads (aka
 * "request threads"). The pool handles I/O completion events and executes
 * application-provided entities such as the request- and error handlers. The
 * pool size is fixed and set to the value of {@link Config#threadPoolSize()}.
 * <p>
 * 
 * It is <strong>absolutely crucial</strong> that the application does not block
 * a request thread, for example by synchronously waiting on an I/O result. The
 * request thread is suitable only for short-lived and CPU-bound work. I/O work
 * or long-lived tasks should execute somewhere else. Blocking the request
 * thread will have a negative impact on scalability and could at worse starve
 * the pool of available threads making the server unable to make progress with
 * tasks such as accepting new client connections or processing other
 * requests.<p>
 * 
 * This is bad:
 * <pre>
 *   RequestHandler h = GET().{@link RequestHandler.Builder#accept(RequestHandler.Logic)
 *         accept}((request, channel) -{@literal >} {
 *       String data = database.fetch("SELECT * FROM Something"); // {@literal <}-- blocks!
 *       Response resp = {@link Responses}.text(data);
 *       channel.{@link ClientChannel#write(CompletionStage)
 *         write}(resp); // {@literal <}-- never blocks. Server is fully asynchronous.
 *   });
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Instead, do this:
 * <pre>
 *   RequestHandler h = GET().accept((request, channel) -{@literal >} {
 *       CompletionStage{@literal <}String{@literal >} data = database.fetchAsync("SELECT * FROM Something");
 *       CompletionStage{@literal <}Response{@literal >} resp = data.thenApply(Responses::text);
 *       channel.write(resp);
 *   });
 * </pre>
 * 
 * The problem is <i>not</i> synchronously producing a response <i>if</i> one
 * can be produced without blocking.
 * <pre>
 *   RequestHandler h = GET().accept((request, channel) -{@literal >} {
 *       Response resp = text(String.join(" ", "Short-lived", "CPU-bound work", "is fine!"));
 *       channel.write(resp);
 *   });
 * </pre>
