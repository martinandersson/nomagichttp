/**
 * Listens on a port for HTTP connections.<p>
 * 
 * The server's function is to provide port- and channel management, parse
 * an inbound request head and resolve a handler against a target route (also
 * known as a "server resource") that is qualified to handle the request. The
 * handler has almost total freedom in regards to how it interprets the request
 * headers- and body as well as what headers and body it responds.<p>
 * 
 * The process of receiving a request and respond responses (any number of
 * intermittent responses, followed by a final response) is often called an
 * "exchange".<p>
 * 
 * This interface declares static <i>{@code create}</i> methods that construct
 * and return the default implementation {@link DefaultServer}. Once the server
 * has been constructed, it needs to <i>{@code start()}</i> which will open the
 * server's listening port.<p>
 * 
 * Routes can be dynamically added and removed using {@link #add(Route)
 * add(Route)} and {@link #remove(Route) remove(Route)}. A legal server variant
 * is to not even have any routes registered. The idea is that resources (what's
 * "behind the route") can be short-lived and serve very specific purposes, so
 * their presence can change.<p>
 * 
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 *   HttpServer.{@link #create(ErrorHandler...)
 *     create}().{@link #add(String, RequestHandler, RequestHandler...)
 *       add}("/", {@link RequestHandler#GET()
 *         GET}().{@link RequestHandler.Builder#respond(Response)
 *           respond}({@link Responses#text(String)
 *             text}("Hello"))).{@link #start() start}();
 * </pre>
 * 
 * 
 * <h2>Server Life-Cycle</h2>
 * 
 * It is possible to start server instances on different ports. One use-case for
 * this pattern is to expose public endpoints on one port but keep more
 * sensitive administrator endpoints on another more secluded port.<p>
 * 
 * TODO: Give StructuredTaskScope example.<p>
 * 
 * A server instance can not be recycled; it can only start and stop once.<p>
 * 
 * 
 * <h2>Supported HTTP Versions</h2>
 *
 * Currently, the NoMagicHTTP server is a project in its infancy. Almost
 * complete support for HTTP/1.0 and 1.1 is the first milestone, yet to be done
 * (see POA.md in repository). HTTP/2 will be implemented thereafter. HTTP
 * clients older than HTTP/1.0 is rejected (the exchange will crash with a
 * {@link HttpVersionTooOldException}).<p>
 * 
 * 
 * <h2>Thread Safety and Threading Model</h2>
 * 
 * All methods found on the {@code HttpServer} interface are thread-safe.<p>
 * 
 * The default implementation uses virtual threads to handle inbound
 * connections, invoke the application's request handlers and so on. Using
 * virtual threads enables the rest of the library API to expose a simple and
 * semantically blocking API to the application code, but virtual threads do not
 * block; instead they will unmount from the carrier thread making it available
 * to be mounted by a different virtual thread.<p>
 * 
 * It is safe to call methods found in the {@code HttpServer} interface, its
 * super-interfaces and related API (e.g. constructing objects such as routes
 * and handlers) from a native thread.<p>
 * 
 * However, application code executing within the scope of an HTTP exchange
 * should not use other parts of the library API from a native thread. Parts of
 * the API that would've caused a native thread to block reserves the right to
 * throw a {@link WrongThreadException}, if called using a native thread.<p>
 * 
 * TODO: Give bad example of concurrent outbound calls to dependent services
 * using a parallel Stream on native threads.<p>
 * 
 * TODO: Give good example using {@link StructuredTaskScope}<p>
 * 
 * 
 * <h2>HTTP message semantics</h2>
 * 
 * Only a very few message variants are specified to <i>not</i> have a body and
 * will be rejected by the server if they do ({@link
 * IllegalRequestBodyException}, {@link IllegalResponseBodyException}). These
 * variants <i>must</i> be rejected since including a body would have likely
 * killed the protocol.<p>
 * 
 * For all other variants of requests and responses, the body is optional and
 * the server does not reject the message based on the presence (or absence) of
 * a body. This is mostly true for all other message variants as well; the
 * server does not have an opinionated view unless an opinionated view is
 * warranted. The request handler is almost in full control over how it
 * interprets the request message and what response it returns with no
 * interference from the server.<p>
 * 
 * For example, it might not be common but it <i>is</i>
 * allowed for {@link HttpConstants.Method#GET GET} requests (
 * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.1">RFC 7231 ยง4.3.1</a>
 * ) to have a body and for {@link HttpConstants.Method#POST POST} requests to
 * not have a body (
 * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2">RFC 7230 ยง3.3.2</a>
 * ). Similarly, the {@link HttpConstants.StatusCode#TWO_HUNDRED_ONE 201
 * (Created)} response often do have a body which "typically describes and links
 * to the resource(s) created" (
 * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.3.2">RFC 7231 ยง6.3.2</a>
 * ), but it's not required to. And so the list goes on.
