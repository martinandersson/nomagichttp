/**
 * A server receives HTTP {@link Request requests}, routes these to a {@link
 * Route route} and then calls a qualified {@link Handler handler} of that route
 * to process the request into a {@link Response response}.<p>
 * 
 * Even though a server without any routes is a legal variant, at least one must
 * be added to its {@link #getRouteRegistry() route registry} in order for the
 * server to do meaningful work.<p>
 * 
 * This interface declares static <i>{@code with}</i> methods that construct
 * and return the default implementation {@link AsyncServer}. Then, what remains
 * is to use any of the {@code start} methods to start the server on an
 * address.<p>
 * 
 * The server's function is to provide port- and channel management, parse
 * an inbound request head and resolve which handler of a route is qualified to
 * handle the request. The server will not apply or validate HTTP semantics once
 * the handler has been called. The handler is in complete control over how it
 * interprets the request headers- and body as well as what headers and body it
 * responds.
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>Server Life-Cycle</h3>
 * 
 * It is possible to start many server instances on different ports. One
 * use-case for this pattern is to expose public endpoints on one port but
 * more sensitive administrator endpoints on another more secluded port.<p>
 * 
 * If at least one server is running, then the JVM will not shutdown when the
 * main application thread returns. For the application process to end, all
 * server instances must {@link #stop()}.
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>Error Handling</h3>
 * 
 * TODO: Write
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>Channel Life-Cycle</h3>
 * 
 * TODO: Write
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>Threading Model</h3>
 * 
 * The server instance is thread-safe.<p>
 * 
 * The server has a pool of threads (many times referred to as "request
 * threads"). This pool executes managerial tasks that 1) accept new child
 * channels on a listening port (HTTP connections), 2) read/write bytes on the
 * child channels and 3) invoke the application-provided request handler.<p>
 * 
 * The server thread pool is designed for short-lived CPU-bound tasks and
 * request handlers should thread-off for blocking I/O operations or any other
 * type of work that is anticipated to take a long time to complete. Failure to
 * do so could starve the pool of threads able to perform other work,
 * potentially with a negative impact on scalability.<p>
 * 
 * A future API will expose the server tread pool for re-use by
 * application-provided, CPU-bound and short-lived tasks without having to
 * create yet another pool (which is a problem in all other to-date known
 * frameworks). For example, when an I/O thread returns with the result,
 * packaging the result into a client-response should be done by a request
 * thread and not the I/O thread (TODO Implement).<p>
 * 
 * In the event many servers are started on different ports, they all share the
 * same underlying thread pool.
 *
