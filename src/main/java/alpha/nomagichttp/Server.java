/**
 * A server receives HTTP {@link Request requests}, routes these to a {@link
 * Route route} and then calls a qualified {@link Handler handler} of that route
 * to process the request into a {@link Response response}.<p>
 * 
 * Even though a server without any routes is a legal variant, at least one must
 * be added to its {@link #getRouteRegistry() route registry} in order for the
 * server to do meaningful work.<p>
 * 
 * This interface declares static <i>{@code with}</i> methods that construct
 * and return the default implementation {@link AsyncServer}. Then, what remains
 * is to use any of the {@code start} methods to start the server on an
 * address.<p>
 * 
 * The server's function is to provide port- and channel management, parse
 * an inbound request head and resolve which handler of a route is qualified to
 * handle the request. The server will not apply or validate HTTP semantics once
 * the handler has been called. The handler is in complete control over how it
 * interprets the request headers- and body as well as what headers and body it
 * responds.
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>Server Life-Cycle</h3>
 * 
 * It is possible to start many server instances on different ports. One
 * use-case for this pattern is to expose public endpoints on one port but
 * more sensitive administrator endpoints on another more secluded port.<p>
 * 
 * If at least one server is running, then the JVM will not shutdown when the
 * main application thread dies. For the application process to end, all
 * server instances must {@link #stop()}.
 * 
 * 
 * <h3>Threading Model</h3>
 * 
 * The server instance is thread-safe.<p>
 * 
 * The server uses only one pool of threads (many times referred to as "request
 * threads"). This pool handles I/O completion events and executes
 * application-provided entities such as the request- and error handlers. The
 * pool size is fixed and set to the value of {@link
 * ServerConfig#threadPoolSize()} at the time of the first server start.<p>
 * 
 * It is absolutely crucial that the application does not block a request
 * thread, for example by synchronously waiting on an I/O result. The request
 * thread is suitable only for short-lived and CPU-bound work. I/O work or
 * long-lived tasks should execute somewhere else. Blocking the request thread
 * will have a negative impact on scalability and could at worse starve the pool
 * of available threads making the server unable to make progress with tasks
 * such as accepting new client connections or processing other requests.<p>
 * 
 * Servers started on different ports all share the same underlying thread pool.
