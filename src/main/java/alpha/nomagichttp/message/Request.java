/**
 * An inbound HTTP request.<p>
 * 
 * The {@link Handler request handler} will be invoked as soon as the request
 * head has been fully parsed and to the extent necessarily; interpreted by the
 * server. The contents of the request body will arrive asynchronously and is
 * exposed through the {@link #body() method}.<p>
 * 
 * Methods on this interface that document {@code IllegalStateException} will
 * never throw the exception when accessed by a <i>request handler</i>. However,
 * the exception may be thrown when accessed by an <i>{@link ExceptionHandler
 * exception handler}</i> as these handlers may be called earlier in time before
 * all of the parts of the request object has been bound.<p>
 * 
 * The implementation is thread-safe.<p>
 * 
 * The request handler is not required to consume the request or its body. If
 * there is a body present and it is not consumed then it will be silently
 * discarded as late in the HTTP exchange process as possible, which is when the
 * server's {@link Response#body() response body} subscription completes.<p>

     * given to the subscriber from the server when subscribing to the request
     * body, may be called by any thread at any time.<p>
     * 
     * 
     * <h3>Subscribing to bytes with a {@code Flow.Subscriber}</h3>
     * 
     * The subscriber will receive bytebuffers in the same order they are read
     * from the underlying channel (the subscriber can not read passed the body
     * boundary because the server will complete the subscription and possibly
     * limit the last bytebuffer).<p>
     * 
     * The subscriber may request/demand any number of bytebuffers and even
     * process them asynchronously, but only when the bytebuffer has been {@link
     * PooledByteBufferHolder#release() released} will the next bytebuffer be
     * published.<p>
     * 
     * Releasing the bytebuffer with bytes remaining to be read will cause the
     * bytebuffer to immediately be re-published.<p>
     * 
     * Cancelling the subscription does not cause the bytebuffer to be released.
     * Releasing has to be done explicitly, or implicitly through an exceptional
     * return of {@code Subscriber.onNext()}. An exceptional return from onNext
     * will also void the subscription which just like {@code
     * Subscription.cancel} [perhaps eventually] stops the publisher from
     * publishing more items.<p>
     * 
     * The HTTP exchange is considered done as soon as both the server's
     * response body subscription <i>and</i> the application's request body
     * subscription have both completed. Not until then will the next HTTP
     * message-exchange commence. This means that a request body subscriber must
     * ensure his subscription runs all the way to the end or is cancelled.
     * Subscribing to the body but never complete the subscription will lead to
     * a halt in progress for the underlying channel.<p>
     * 
     * However, if the server's response body subscription completes and no
     * request body subscriber arrived, then the server will assume the body was
     * intentionally ignored and proceed to discard it, after which it can not
     * be subscribed to by the application any more.<p>
     * 
     * If a response must be sent back immediately but processing the
     * request body bytes must be delayed, then there's at least two ways of
     * solving this. Either delay completing the server's response body
     * subscription or register a request body subscriber but delay requesting
     * items.<p>
     * 
     * Finally, as a word of caution; the default implementation uses
     * <i>direct</i> bytebuffers in order to support "zero-copy" transfers.
     * I.e., no data is moved into Java heap space unless the subscriber itself
     * causes this to happen. Whenever possible, always pass forward the
     * bytebuffers to the destination without reading the bytes in application
     * code.<p>
     * 
     * The implementation is thread-safe.
