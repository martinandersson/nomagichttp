     * necessarily have made it through on the network.<p>
     * 
     * The body bytes may be converted into any arbitrary Java type using the
     * {@link #convert(BiFunction)} method or consumed directly "on arrival"
     * using the {@link #subscribe(Flow.Subscriber)} method.<p>
     * 
     * The implementation is thread-safe. In particular - and unlike the
     * unbelievably restrictive rule ยง3.1 in an otherwise very "async-oriented"
     * <a href="https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/tree/d4d08aadf7d6b4345b2e59f756adeaafd998fec7#3-subscription-code">Reactive Streams</a>
     * specification - methods on the {@link Flow.Subscription} instance
     * given to the body subscriber may be called by any thread at any time.<p>
     * 
     * The body bytes can not be directly consumed more than once; they are not
     * saved by the server. An attempt to {@code convert(...)} or {@code
     * subscribe(...)} more than once will result in an {@code
     * IllegalStateException}.<p>
     * 
     * Same is is also true for utility methods that "trickle down". If for
     * example method {@code convert(...)} is used followed by {@code toText()},
     * then the latter will complete exceptionally with an {@code
     * IllegalStateException}.<p>
     *
     * It does not matter if a {@code Flow.Subscription} is immediately
     * cancelled with or without actually consuming any bytes (application is
     * assumed to ignore the body, followed by a server-side discard of it).<p>
     * 
     * However, some utility methods such as {@code toText()} may save and
     * return the same stage for future re-use, for example by an {@link
     * ExceptionHandler exception handler} who may also be interested in
     * accessing the request body.<p>
     * 
     * The normal way to reject an operation is to fail-fast and blow up the
     * calling thread, even rejected asynchronous operations. For example,
     * {@code ExecutorService.submit()} throws {@code
     * RejectedExceptionException} and {@code AsynchronousByteChannel.read()}
     * throws {@code IllegalArgumentException}.<p>
     * 
     * However - for good or bad - the Reactive Streams specification mandates
     * that all exceptions are signalled through the subscriber. In order then
     * to have a coherent API, all exceptions produced by the Body API will be
     * delivered through the result carrier ({@code CompletionStage} and {@code
     * Flow.Subscriber}). This also has the implication that exceptions are not
     * documented using the standard {@code @throws} tag but rather inline with
     * the rest of the text. The only exception to this rule is {@code
     * NullPointerException} which will blow up the calling thread wherever
     * warranted.<p>
     * 
     * In general, high-level exception types - in particular, when documented -
     * does not close the underlying channel and so the application can chose to
     * recover from them. The reverse is true for unexpected errors, in
     * particular, errors that originates from the underlying channel. The
     * safest bet for an application when attempting error recovery is to always
     * check first if the channel is still open ({@code
     * Request.channel().isOpen()}).<p>
     * 
     * 
     * <h3>Subscribing to bytes with a {@code Flow.Subscriber}</h3>
     * 
     * The subscriber will receive bytebuffers in the same order they are read
     * from the underlying channel. The subscriber can not read beyond the
     * message/body boundary because the server will complete the subscription
     * before then and if need be, limit the last bytebuffer.<p>
     * 
     * <h4>Releasing</h4>
     * 
     * The published bytebuffers are pooled and may be processed synchronously
     * or asynchronously. Whenever the application has finished processing
     * a bytebuffer, it must be {@link PooledByteBufferHolder#release()
     * released} which is a signal to the server that the bytebuffer may be
     * re-used for new channel operations. The thread doing the release may be
     * used to immediately publish new bytebuffers to the subscriber or initiate
     * new asynchronous operations on the underlying channel.<p>
     * 
     * Releasing the bytebuffer with bytes remaining to be read will cause the
     * bytebuffer to immediately become available for re-publication (ahead of
     * other bytebuffers already available).<p>
     * 
     * Cancelling the subscription does not cause the bytebuffer to be released.
     * Releasing has to be done explicitly, or implicitly through an exceptional
     * return of {@code Subscriber.onNext()}.<p>
     * 
     * <h4>Processing bytebuffers</h4>
     * 
     * The subscriber may request/demand any number of bytebuffers, but may
     * only receive the next bytebuffer after the previous one has been
     * released.<p>
     * 
     * Currently, the default implementation does only publish one bytebuffer at
     * a time and so with this implementation, awaiting more buffers before
     * releasing old ones will inevitably halt progress.<p>
     * 
     * In order to fully support concurrent processing of many bytebuffers
     * without the risk of adding unnecessary delays or blockages, the Body API
     * would have to declare methods that the application can use to learn how
     * many bytebuffers are immediately available and possibly also learn the
     * size of the server's bytebuffer pool.<p>
     * 
     * This is not very likely to happen. Not only will concurrent processing be
     * a challenge for the application to implement properly with respect to
     * byte order and message integrity, but concurrent processing could also be
     * a sign that the application's processing code may block the request
     * thread (see "Threading Model" in {@link Server}) - hence the need to
     * "collect" or buffer the bytebuffers.<p>
     * 
     * As an example, {@code GatheringByteChannel} expects a {@code
     * ByteBuffer[]} but is a blocking API. Instead, submit the bytebuffers one
     * at a time to {@code AsynchronousByteChannel}, releasing each in the
     * completion handler.<p>
     * 
     * Given how the default implementation only publishes one bytebuffer at a
     * time, there's really no difference between requesting {@code
     * Long.MAX_VALUE} versus requesting only one bytebuffer at a time.<p>
     * 
     * Unfortunately, the Reactive Stream specification calls the latter
     * approach an "inherently inefficient 'stop-and-wait' protocol". This is
     * wrong. The bytebuffers are pooled and cached upstream already. Requesting
     * a bytebuffer is essentially the same as polling a stupidly fast queue of
     * available buffers and there simply does not exist - surprise surprise - a
     * good reason to engage in "premature optimization".<p>
     * 
     * Speaking of optimization; the default implementation uses <i>direct</i>
     * bytebuffers in order to support "zero-copy" transfers. I.e., no data is
     * moved into Java heap space unless the subscriber itself causes this to
     * happen. Whenever possible, always pass forward the bytebuffers to the
     * destination without reading the bytes in application code!<p>
     * 
     * <h4>Thread Semantics</h4>
     * 
     * All signals to the subscriber are executed serially with a happens-before
     * relationship. Assuming the class data is not accessed by foreign threads
     * outside of the delivery of these signals; no special care needs to be put
     * in place such as volatile- and/or atomic fields.<p>
     * 
     * The effect of {@code Subscription.request()} - if called by the thread
     * delivering a signal to the subscriber - will not be immediate. Instead
     * the requested demand/value will be scheduled and then the method returns.
     * I.e., {@code Subscriber.onSubscribe()} and {@code Subscriber.onNext()}
     * will always complete without reentrancy and recursion.<p>
     * 
     * However, an asynchronous call to {@code request()} may prompt the same
     * thread to immediately get busy delivering the next subscriber signal.<p>
     * 
     * {@code Subscription.cancel()} will only have an immediate effect if
     * called by the thread running the subscriber. If called asynchronously,
     * the effect may be eventual and the subscriber may observe a bytebuffer
     * delivery even after the cancel method returns (at most one "extra"
     * delivery).<p>
     * 
     * <h4>The HTTP exchange and body discarding</h4>
     * 
     * The HTTP exchange is considered done as soon as both the server's
     * response body subscription <i>and</i> the application's request body
     * subscription have both completed. Not until then will the next HTTP
     * message-exchange commence on the same channel.<p>
     * 
     * This means that a request body subscriber must ensure his subscription
     * runs all the way to the end or is cancelled. Subscribing to the body but
     * never completing the subscription may lead to a progress halt for the
     * underlying channel (there is no timeout in the NoMagicHTTP library
     * code).<p>
     * 
     * If the server's response body subscription completes and earliest at that
     * point no request body subscriber has arrived, then the server will assume
     * that the body was intentionally ignored and proceed to discard it - after
     * which it can not be subscribed to by the application any more.<p>
     * 
     * If a response must be sent back immediately but processing the
     * request body bytes must be delayed, then there's at least two ways of
     * solving this. Either delay completing the server's response body
     * subscription or register a request body subscriber but delay requesting
     * items.<p>
     * 
     * <h4>Exception Handling</h4>
     * 
     * Exceptions thrown by the {@code Flow.Subscriber.onSubscribe()} method
     * propagates to the calling thread, i.e., the one calling {@code
     * Request.Body.subscribe()}. If this thread is the request thread, then
     * standard {@link ExceptionHandler exception handling} is kicked off.<p>
     * 
     * Exceptions thrown by the subscriber's {@code onNext()} and {@code
     * onComplete()} methods will cause the server to log the error and perform
     * the channel-close procedure documented in {@link
     * Response#mustCloseAfterWrite()}. This will also void the underlying
     * subscription and even though {@code onError()} is meant to be a vehicle
     * for <i>publisher</i> errors, the server will still gracefully complete
     * the subscription by signalling a {@link ClosedPublisherException}.<p>
     * 
     * Exceptions signalled to {@code Subscriber.onError()} indicates low-level
     * problems with the underlying channel, meaning it's quite futile for the
     * application to try to recover from them. The error will already have been
     * logged by the server who also performed the channel-close procedure
     * documented in {@code Response.mustCloseAfterWrite()}.<p>
     * 
     * Exceptions from {@code Subscriber.onError()} itself will be logged but
     * otherwise ignored.<p>
     * 
     * Even if the server has a reaction for some observed exceptions - such as
     * closing the channel as previously noted - this doesn't stop the exception
     * from being propagated. For example, if the application asynchronously
     * calls {@code Subscription.request()} from a new thread, a call which
     * might immediately and synchronously trigger the publication of a new item
     * delivery to {@code Subscriber.onNext()}, and if this method in turn
     * returns exceptionally which prompts the server to intercept and close the
     * channel, then the application code will still return exceptionally from
     * it's call to the top-level {@code Subscription.request()} method
     * observing the same exception instance.
