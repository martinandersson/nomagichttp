/**
 * An inbound HTTP request.<p>
 * 
 * The request handler is not required to consume the request or its body. If
 * there is a body present, and it is not consumed then it will be silently
 * discarded as late in the HTTP exchange process as possible, which is when the
 * server's {@link Response#body() response body} subscription completes.<p>
 * 
 * The implementation is thread-safe, non-blocking and shallowly immutable.
 * Collaborating components too are thread-safe, but not necessarily immutable.
 * E.g. attribute entries and caching layers such as the lazy processing of path
 * parameters, the query string and header parsing.<p>
 * 
 * The request object does not implement {@code hashCode()} and {@code
 * equals()}. Its identity is unique per receiver (see {@link
 * ReceiverOfUniqueRequestObject}).

     * An API to access segments, path parameters (interpreted segments), query

     * 
     * Path parameters come in two forms; single- and catch-all. The former is
     * required in order for the action/handler to have been matched, the latter
     * is optional but the server will make sure the value is always present and
     * begins with a '/'. Query parameters are always optional. Read more in
     * {@link Route}.<p>
     * 
     * A query value will be assumed to end with a space, ampersand ('&amp;') or
     * number sign ('&#35;') character. In particular, please note that the
     * semicolon ('&#59;') has no special meaning; it will <i>not</i> be
     * processed as a separator (contrary to
     * <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/appendix/notes.html#h-B.2.2">W3</a>,
     * we argue that magic is the trouble).<p>
     * 
     * The exact structure of the query string is not standardized (
     * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string">Wikipedia</a>). The
     * NoMagicHTTP library supports repeated query keys and query keys with no
     * value (will be mapped to the empty string "").<p>
     * 
     * Tokens (path parameter values, query keys/values) are not interpreted or
     * parsed by the HTTP server. In particular, please note that there is no
     * API-support for so called <i>path matrix variables</i> (nor is this magic
     * standardized) and appending brackets ("[]") to the query key has no
     * special meaning; it will simply become part of the query key itself.<p>
     * 
     * If embedding multiple query values into one key entry is desired, then
     * splitting and parsing the value with whatever delimiting character one
     * choose is pretty straight forward:
     * 
     * <pre>{@code
     *     // "?numbers=1,2,3"
     *     // WARNING: This ignores the presence of repeated entries
     *     String[] vals = request.target()
     *                            .queryFirst("numbers")
     *                            .get()
     *                            .split(",");
     *     int[] ints = Arrays.stream(vals)
     *                        .mapToInt(Integer::parseInt)
     *                        .toArray();
     * }</pre>
     * 
     * Instead of using a non-standardized separator, it's far more straight
     * forward and fool-proof (number separator would be dependent on regional
     * format) to rely on repetition instead:
     * 
     * <pre>{@code
     *     // "?number=1&number=2&number=3"
     *     int[] ints = request.target()
     *                         .queryStream("number")
     *                         .mapToInt(Integer::parseInt)
     *                         .toArray();
     * }</pre>
     * 
     * Methods that does not carry the "raw" suffix will URL decode (aka.
     * percent-decode, aka. escape) the tokens (segment values, query keys,
     * path- and query parameter values) as if using
     * {@link URLDecoder#decode(String, Charset) URLDecoder.decode(segment,
     * StandardCharsets.UTF_8)} <i>except</i> the plus sign ('+') is <i>not</i>
     * converted to a space character and remains the same. If this is not
     * desired, use methods that carries the suffix "raw". The raw version is
     * useful when need be to unescape values using a different strategy, for
     * example when receiving a query string from a browser submitting an HTML
     * form using the "GET" method. The default encoding the browser uses will
     * be
     * <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1">
     * application/x-www-form-urlencoded</a> which escapes space characters
     * using the plus character ('+').
     * 
     * <pre>{@code
     *     // Note: key needs to be in its raw form
     *     String nondecoded = request.target().queryFirstRaw("q");
     *     // '+' is replaced with ' '
     *     String formdata = java.net.URLDecoder.decode(nondecoded, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

     * after the server is done parsing the request head. At this point in time,
     * not all bytes will necessarily have made it through on the network.<p>
     * 
     * The body bytes may be converted into any arbitrary Java type using the
     * {@link #convert(BiFunction)} method or consumed directly "on arrival"
     * using the {@link #subscribe(Flow.Subscriber)} method.<p>
     * 
     * If the body {@link #isEmpty()}; {@code subscribe()} completes the
     * subscription immediately. {@code toText()} completes immediately with an
     * empty string. {@code toFile()} completes immediately with 0 bytes. {@code
     * convert()} immediately invokes its given function with an empty byte
     * array. {@code subscribe(Flow.Publisher)} will delegate to {@link
     * Publishers#empty()}<p>
     * 
     * The body bytes can not be directly consumed more than once; they are not
     * saved by the server. An attempt to {@code convert()} or {@code
     * subscribe()} more than once will result in an {@code
     * IllegalStateException}.<p>
     * 
     * Same is is also true for utility methods that trickle down. If for
     * example {@code convert()} is used followed by {@code toText()}, then the
     * latter will complete exceptionally with an {@code
     * IllegalStateException}.<p>
     * 
     * And, it does not matter if a {@code Flow.Subscription} is immediately
     * cancelled with or without actually consuming any bytes. Subscription
     * cancellation will cause the body to be discarded.<p>
     * 
     * Some utility methods such as {@code toText()} cache the result and will
     * return the same stage on future invocations.<p>
     * 
     * The normal way to reject an operation is to fail-fast and blow up the
     * calling thread. This is also common practice for rejected
     * <i>asynchronous</i> operations. For example,
     * {@code ExecutorService.submit()} throws {@code
     * RejectedExceptionException} and {@code AsynchronousByteChannel.read()}
     * throws {@code IllegalArgumentException}.<p>
     * 
     * However - for good or bad - the <a
     * href="https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/blob/v1.0.3/README.md">
     * Reactive Streams</a> specification mandates that all exceptions are
     * signalled through the subscriber. In order then to have a coherent API,
     * all exceptions produced by the Body API will be delivered through the
     * result carrier; whether that is a {@code CompletionStage} or a {@code
     * Flow.Subscriber}. This has the implication that exceptions from utility
     * methods are not documented using the standard {@code @throws} tag but
     * rather inline with the rest of the JavaDoc. The only exception to this
     * rule is {@code NullPointerException} which will blow up the calling
     * thread wherever warranted.<p>
     * 
     * In general, high-level exception types - in particular, when documented -
     * occurs before a real subscription is made and will leave the channel's
     * read stream open. The application can generally attempt a new operation
     * to recover the body (e.g. {@code toText() >} {@code
     * IllegalCharsetNameException}). Unexpected errors - in particular, errors
     * that originate from the channel's read operation - have used up a real
     * subscription and also closed the read stream (e.g. {@code
     * RequestBodyTimeoutException}). Before attempting to recover the body,
     * always check first if the {@link ClientChannel#isOpenForReading()}.
     * 
     * 
     * <h2>Subscribing to bytes with a {@code Flow.Subscriber}</h2>
     * 
     * Almost all of the same {@code Flow.Publisher} semantics specified in the
     * JavaDoc of {@link Publishers} applies to the {@code Body} as a publisher
     * as well. The only exception is that the body does not support subscriber
     * reuse, again because the server does not keep the bytes after
     * consumption.<p>
     * 
     * The subscriber will receive bytebuffers in the same order they are read
     * from the underlying channel. The subscriber can not read beyond the
     * message/body boundary because the server will complete the subscription
     * before then and if need be, limit the last bytebuffer.
     * 
     * <h3>Releasing</h3>
     * 
     * The published bytebuffers are pooled and may be processed synchronously
     * or asynchronously. Whenever the application has finished processing
     * a bytebuffer, it must be {@link PooledByteBufferHolder#release()
     * released} which is a signal to the server that the bytebuffer may be
     * reused for new channel operations. The thread doing the release may be
     * used to immediately publish new bytebuffers to the subscriber.<p>
     * 
     * Releasing the bytebuffer with bytes remaining to be read will cause the
     * bytebuffer to immediately become available for re-publication (ahead of
     * other bytebuffers already available).<p>
     * 
     * Cancelling the subscription does not cause the bytebuffer to be released.
     * Releasing has to be done explicitly, or implicitly through an exceptional
     * return of {@code Subscriber.onNext()}.
     * 
     * <h3>Processing bytebuffers</h3>
     * 
     * The subscriber may request/demand any number of bytebuffers, but will
     * only receive the next bytebuffer after the previous one has been
     * released. So, awaiting more buffers before releasing old ones will
     * inevitably result in a {@link RequestBodyTimeoutException}.<p>
     * 
     * For the Body API to support concurrent processing of many
     * bytebuffers without the risk of adding unnecessary delays or blockages,
     * the API would have to declare methods that the application can use to
     * learn how many bytebuffers are immediately available and possibly also
     * learn the size of the server's bytebuffer pool.<p>
     * 
     * This is not very likely to ever happen for a number of reasons. The API
     * complexity would increase dramatically for a doubtful benefit. In fact,
     * concurrent processing would most likely corrupt byte order and message
     * integrity.<p>
     * 
     * If there is a need for the application to "collect" or buffer the
     * bytebuffers, then this is a sign that the application's processing code
     * would have blocked the request thread (see "Threading Model" in {@link
     * HttpServer}). For example, {@link GatheringByteChannel} expects a {@code
     * ByteBuffer[]} but is a blocking API. Instead, submit the bytebuffers one
     * at a time to {@link AsynchronousByteChannel}, releasing each in the
     * completion handler.<p>
     * 
     * Given how only one bytebuffer at a time is published then there's no
     * difference between requesting {@code Long.MAX_VALUE} versus requesting
     * one at a time. Unfortunately, the
     * <a href="https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/blob/v1.0.3/README.md">
     * Reactive Streams</a> calls the latter approach an "inherently inefficient
     * 'stop-and-wait' protocol". In our context, this is wrong. The bytebuffers
     * are pooled and cached upstream already. Requesting a bytebuffer is
     * essentially the same as polling a stupidly fast queue of buffers. The
     * advantage of requesting {@code Long.MAX_VALUE} is implementation
     * simplicity.<p>
     * 
     * The default implementation uses <i>direct</i> bytebuffers in order to
     * support "zero-copy" transfers. I.e., no data is moved into Java heap
     * space unless the subscriber itself causes this to happen. Whenever
     * possible, always pass forward the bytebuffers to the destination without
     * reading the bytes in application code!
     * 
     * <h3>The HTTP exchange and body discarding</h3>
     * 
     * The HTTP exchange is considered done as soon as 1) the request handler
     * invocation has returned, and 2) the request body subscription completes,
     * and 3) the final response body subscription completes. Not until then
     * will the next HTTP message-exchange commence on the same channel.<p>
     * 
     * This means that a request body subscriber should ensure his subscription
     * runs all the way to the end or is cancelled. Failure to request items in
     * a timely manner will result in a {@link RequestBodyTimeoutException}.<p>
     * 
     * But the application does not have to consume the body explicitly. When
     * the server's final response body subscription completes and earliest at
     * that point no request body subscriber has arrived, then the server will
     * assume that the body was intentionally ignored and proceed to discard it
     * - after which it can not be subscribed to by the application any more.<p>
     * 
     * If a final response must be sent back immediately but reading the request
     * body bytes must be delayed, then there's at least two ways of solving
     * this. Either register a request body subscriber but delay requesting
     * items, or delay completing the server's response body subscription. Both
     * approaches are still subject to {@link
     * Config#timeoutIdleConnection()}. There is currently no API support to
     * temporarily suspend timeouts.
     * 
     * <h3>Exception Handling</h3>
     * 
     * The {@code Body} as a publisher follows the same exception semantics
     * specified in the JavaDoc of {@link Publishers}, decorated with some added
     * behavior on top.<p>
     * 
     * An exception thrown by {@code
     * Flow.Subscriber.onSubscribe()/onNext()/onComplete()} propagates to the
     * calling thread. If this thread is the HTTP server's request thread, then
     * standard {@link ErrorHandler error handling} is kicked off.<p>
     * 
     * An exception thrown by the subscriber's {@code onNext()} will cause the
     * server to close the channel's read stream (the write stream remains
     * untouched so that a response in-flight can complete or a new one
     * commence).<p>
     * 
     * Exceptions signalled to {@code Subscriber.onError()} that are <i>not
     * caused by</i> the subscriber itself can safely be assumed to indicate
     * low-level problems with the underlying channel. They will also have been
     * logged by the HTTP server followed suite by read-stream closure.
