     * An API for accessing the request body, either as a high-level Java type

     * bytes by using the low-level {@link #subscribe(Flow.Subscriber)
     * subscribe(Flow.Subscriber&lt;PooledByteBufferHolder&gt;)} method.<p>
     * 
     * The application should consume the body, even if this entails
     * <i>discarding</i> it. Not consuming all of the body will have the effect
     * that the server crashes when attempting to subsequently subscribe a
     * request head parser.<p>
     * 
     * An attempt to consume the body more than once should not be done and has
     * undefined application behavior. The default implementation does not save
     * the bytes once they have been consumed.<p>
     * 
     * 
     * <h3>Subscribing to bytes with a {@code Flow.Subscriber}</h3>
     *
     * The subscription will be completed as soon as the server has determined
     * that the end of the body has been reached.<p>
     *
     * If need be, the server will slice the last published bytebuffer to make
     * sure that the subscriber can not accidentally read past the body limit
     * into a subsequent HTTP message from the same channel. I.e., it is safe
     * for the subscriber to read <i>all remaining bytes</i> of each published
     * bytebuffer.<p>
     * 
     * Only one subscriber at a time is allowed. This subscriber will receive
     * bytebuffers orderly as they are read from the underlying channel. The
     * subscriber may process the bytebuffers asynchronously, but only when the
     * bytebuffer has been {@link PooledByteBufferHolder#release() released}
     * will the next bytebuffer be published.<p>
     * 
     * Releasing the bytebuffer with bytes remaining to be read will cause the
     * bytebuffer to be immediately re-published. This makes it possible for a
     * subscriber to cancel his subscription and "hand-off" byte processing to
     * another subscriber (logical framing within the body).<p>
     * 
     * Cancelling the subscription does not cause the bytebuffer to be released.
     * Releasing has to be done explicitly, or implicitly through an exceptional
     * return of {@code Subscriber.onNext()}.<p>
     * 
     * Finally, as a word of caution; the default implementation uses
     * <i>direct</i> bytebuffers in order to support "zero-copy" transfers.
     * I.e., no data is moved into Java heap space unless the subscriber itself
     * causes this to happen. Whenever possible, always pass forward the
     * bytebuffers to the destination without reading the bytes in application
     * code.

    //       fail-fast from the server would be great. B) This probably also
    //       translates to a lot of boilerplate code for some handlers; forced
    //       to "make a decision" and write code for a body they possibly wasn't
    //       even interested in to start with. I propose that the server
    //       auto-discards bodies that wasn't consumed, including partial
    //       bodies - and no logging about it (really up to the handler what he
    //       makes out of the body or the absence of such). In fact, probably
    //       even required behavior, to be applied after error handling. I mean,
    //       what if the handler crashes half-way through consuming the body,
    //       then an error handler "rescues" the situation by responding an
    //       error code. The application would rightfully think that future HTTP
    //       exchanges can take place as if nothing ever happened.
    //       When should auto-discard commence? Probably something like as soon
    //       as the response completes, that's about as much as we can wait. At
    //       this point the server wants to restart a new exchange and he should
    //       be able to assume that the handler was never interested in the body.
