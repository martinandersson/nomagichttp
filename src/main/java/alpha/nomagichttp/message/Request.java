     * Is a thread-safe and non-blocking API for accessing immutable request

     * 
     * Any client-given request path (a component of {@link Request#target()}
     * may contain segments interpreted by the HTTP server as a path parameter
     * value and/or an URL search part, aka. query string (see {@link
     * Route}).<p>
     * 
     * Path parameters come in two forms; single- and catch-all. The former is
     * required in order for the route to have been matched, the latter is
     * optional but the server will make sure the value is always present and
     * begins with a '/'. Query parameters are always optional. Read more in
     * {@link Route}.<p>
     * 
     * A query parameter value will be assumed to end with a space- or ampersand
     * ('&amp;') character. In particular, please note that the semicolon
     * ('&#59;') has no special meaning; it will <i>not</i> be processed as a
     * separator (contrary to
     * <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/appendix/notes.html#h-B.2.2">W3</a>,
     * we argue that magic is the trouble).<p>
     * 
     * The exact structure of the query string is not standardized (
     * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string">Wikipedia</a>). The
     * NoMagicHTTP library supports repeated query keys and query keys with no
     * value (will be mapped to the empty string "").<p>
     * 
     * Tokens (path parameter values, query keys/values) are not interpreted or
     * parsed by the HTTP server. In particular, please note that there is no
     * API-support for so called <i>path matrix variables</i> (nor is this magic
     * standardized) and appending brackets ("[]") to the query key has no
     * special meaning; it will simply become part of the query key itself.<p>
     * 
     * If embedding multiple query values into one key entry is desired, then
     * splitting and parsing the value with whatever delimiting character you
     * choose is pretty straight forward:
     * 
     * <pre>{@code
     *     // "?numbers=1,2,3"
     *     // WARNING: This ignores the presence of repeated entries
     *     String[] vals = request.parameters()
     *                            .queryFirst("numbers")
     *                            .get()
     *                            .split(",");
     *     int[] ints = Arrays.stream(vals)
     *                        .mapToInt(Integer::parseInt)
     *                        .toArray();
     * }</pre>
     * 
     * Instead of using a non-standardized separator, it's far more straight
     * forward and fool-proof (number separator would be dependent on regional
     * format) to rely on repetition instead:
     * 
     * <pre>{@code
     *     // "?number=1&number=2&number=3"
     *     int[] ints = request.parameters()
     *                         .queryStream("number")
     *                         .mapToInt(Integer::parseInt)
     *                         .toArray();
     * }</pre>
     * 
     * Methods in the Parameters API that does not carry the "raw" suffix will
     * URL decode (aka. percent-decode) the tokens (query keys, path- and query
     * parameter values) as if using {@link URLDecoder#decode(String, Charset)
     * URLDecoder.decode(segment, StandardCharsets.UTF_8)} <i>except</i> the
     * plus sign ('+') is <i>not</i> converted to a space character and remains
     * the same. If this is not desired, use methods that carries the suffix
     * "raw". The raw version is useful when need be to unescape values using a
     * different strategy, for example when receiving a query string from a
     * browser submitting an HTML form using the "GET" method. The default
     * encoding the browser uses will be
     * <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1">
     * application/x-www-form-urlencoded</a> which escapes space characters
     * using the plus character ('+').
     * 
     * <pre>{@code
     *     // Note: key needs to be in its raw form
     *     String nondecoded = request.parameters().queryFirstRaw("q");
     *     // '+' is replaced with ' '
     *     String formdata = java.net.URLDecoder.decode(nondecoded, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

     * 
     * High-level methods (for example, {@link #toText()}), returns a {@link
     * CompletionStage} because the request handler will be invoked and
     * therefore have access to the Body API immediately after the server is
     * done parsing the request head. At this point in time, not all bytes will
     * necessarily have made it through on the network.<p>
     * 
     * The body bytes may be converted into any arbitrary Java type using the
     * {@link #convert(BiFunction)} method or consumed directly "on arrival"
     * using the {@link #subscribe(Flow.Subscriber)} method.<p>
     * 
     * If the body {@link #isEmpty()}, {@code subscribe()} completes the
     * subscription immediately. {@code toText()} completes immediately with an
     * empty string. {@code toFile()} completes immediately with 0 bytes. {@code
     * convert()} immediately invokes its given function with an empty byte
     * array.<p>
     * 
     * The body bytes can not be directly consumed more than once; they are not
     * saved by the server. An attempt to {@code convert()} or {@code
     * subscribe()} more than once will result in an {@code
     * IllegalStateException}.<p>
     * 
     * Same is is also true for utility methods that trickle down. If for
     * example {@code convert()} is used followed by {@code toText()}, then the
     * latter will complete exceptionally with an {@code
     * IllegalStateException}.<p>
     * 
     * And, it does not matter if a {@code Flow.Subscription} is immediately
     * cancelled with or without actually consuming any bytes (application is
     * assumed to ignore the body, followed by a server-side discard of it).<p>
     * 
     * Some utility methods such as {@code toText()} cache the result and will
     * return the same stage on future invocations. This may for example be
     * useful when retrying processing logic of the same request.<p>
     * 
     * The normal way to reject an operation is to fail-fast and blow up the
     * calling thread. This is also common practice for rejected
     * <i>asynchronous</i> operations. For example,
     * {@code ExecutorService.submit()} throws {@code
     * RejectedExceptionException} and {@code AsynchronousByteChannel.read()}
     * throws {@code IllegalArgumentException}.<p>
     * 
     * However - for good or bad - the <a
     * href="https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/blob/v1.0.3/README.md">
     * Reactive Streams</a> specification mandates that all exceptions are
     * signalled through the subscriber. In order then to have a coherent API,
     * all exceptions produced by the Body API will be delivered through the
     * result carrier; whether that is a {@code CompletionStage} or a {@code
     * Flow.Subscriber}. This has the implication that exceptions from utility
     * methods are not documented using the standard {@code @throws} tag but
     * rather inline with the rest of the JavaDoc. The only exception to this
     * rule is {@code NullPointerException} which will blow up the calling
     * thread wherever warranted.<p>
     * 
     * In general, high-level exception types - in particular, when documented -
     * does not close the underlying channel's read stream and so the
     * application can choose to recover from them. The opposite is true for
     * unexpected errors, in particular, errors that originate from the
     * channel's read operation. The safest bet for an application when
     * attempting error recovery is to always check first if {@link
     * ChannelOperations#isOpenForReading() request.channel().isOpenForReading()}.
     * 
     * 
     * <h2>Subscribing to bytes with a {@code Flow.Subscriber}</h2>
     * 
     * Almost all of the same {@code Flow.Publisher} semantics specified in the
     * JavaDoc of {@link Publishers} applies to the {@code Body} as a publisher
     * as well. The only exception is that the body does not support subscriber
     * reuse, simply because the body can not be subscribed to more than
     * once.<p>
     * 
     * The subscriber will receive bytebuffers in the same order they are read
     * from the underlying channel. The subscriber can not read beyond the
     * message/body boundary because the server will complete the subscription
     * before then and if need be, limit the last bytebuffer.
     * 
     * <h3>Releasing</h3>
     * 
     * The published bytebuffers are pooled and may be processed synchronously
     * or asynchronously. Whenever the application has finished processing
     * a bytebuffer, it must be {@link PooledByteBufferHolder#release()
     * released} which is a signal to the server that the bytebuffer may be
     * reused for new channel operations. The thread doing the release may be
     * used to immediately publish new bytebuffers to the subscriber.<p>
     * 
     * Releasing the bytebuffer with bytes remaining to be read will cause the
     * bytebuffer to immediately become available for re-publication (ahead of
     * other bytebuffers already available).<p>
     * 
     * Cancelling the subscription does not cause the bytebuffer to be released.
     * Releasing has to be done explicitly, or implicitly through an exceptional
     * return of {@code Subscriber.onNext()}.
     * 
     * <h3>Processing bytebuffers</h3>
     * 
     * The subscriber may request/demand any number of bytebuffers, but will
     * only receive the next bytebuffer after the previous one has been
     * released. So, awaiting more buffers before releasing old ones will
     * inevitably halt progress.<p>
     * 
     * In order to fully support concurrent processing of many bytebuffers
     * without the risk of adding unnecessary delays or blockages, the Body API
     * would have to declare methods that the application can use to learn how
     * many bytebuffers are immediately available and possibly also learn the
     * size of the server's bytebuffer pool.<p>
     * 
     * This is not very likely to happen. Not only will concurrent processing be
     * a challenge for the application to implement properly with respect to
     * byte order and message integrity, but concurrent processing could also be
     * a sign that the application's processing code would have blocked the
     * request thread (see "Threading Model" in {@link HttpServer}) - hence the
     * need to "collect" or buffer the bytebuffers. For example, {@link
     * GatheringByteChannel} expects a {@code ByteBuffer[]} but is a blocking
     * API. Instead, submit the bytebuffers one at a time to {@link
     * AsynchronousByteChannel}, releasing each in the completion handler.<p>
     * 
     * Given how only one bytebuffer at a time is published, there's really no
     * difference between requesting {@code Long.MAX_VALUE} versus requesting
     * one at a time. Unfortunately, the Reactive Stream specification calls the
     * latter approach an "inherently inefficient 'stop-and-wait' protocol".
     * This is wrong. The bytebuffers are pooled and cached upstream already.
     * Requesting a bytebuffer is essentially the same as polling a stupidly
     * fast queue of buffers and there simply does not exist - surprise surprise
     * - a good reason to engage in "premature optimization".<p>
     * 
     * Speaking of optimization; the default implementation uses <i>direct</i>
     * bytebuffers in order to support "zero-copy" transfers. I.e., no data is
     * moved into Java heap space unless the subscriber itself causes this to
     * happen. Whenever possible, always pass forward the bytebuffers to the
     * destination without reading the bytes in application code!
     * 
     * <h3>The HTTP exchange and body discarding</h3>
     * 
     * The HTTP exchange is considered done as soon as both the server's
     * response body subscription <i>and</i> the application's request body
     * subscription have both completed. Not until then will the next HTTP
     * message-exchange commence on the same channel.<p>
     * 
     * This means that a request body subscriber must ensure his subscription
     * runs all the way to the end or is cancelled. Subscribing to the body but
     * never completing the subscription may lead to a progress halt for the
     * underlying channel (there is no timeout in the NoMagicHTTP library
     * code).<p>
     * 
     * If the server's response body subscription completes and earliest at that
     * point no request body subscriber has arrived, then the server will assume
     * that the body was intentionally ignored and proceed to discard it - after
     * which it can not be subscribed to by the application any more.<p>
     * 
     * If a response must be sent back immediately but processing the
     * request body bytes must be delayed, then there's at least two ways of
     * solving this. Either delay completing the server's response body
     * subscription or register a request body subscriber but delay requesting
     * items.
     * 
     * <h3>Exception Handling</h3>
     * 
     * The {@code Body} as a publisher follows the same exception semantics
     * specified in the JavaDoc of {@link Publishers}, decorated with some added
     * behavior on top.<p>
     * 
     * Exceptions thrown by the {@code Flow.Subscriber.onSubscribe()} method
     * propagates to the calling thread, i.e., the one calling {@code
     * Body.subscribe()}. If this thread is the HTTP server's request thread,
     * then standard {@link ErrorHandler error handling} is kicked off.<p>
     * 
     * Exceptions thrown by the subscriber's {@code onNext()} and {@code
     * onComplete()} methods will be logged by the server if the channel's read
     * stream is still open when the exceptional return occur. The server will
     * also close the read stream (the write stream remains untouched so that a
     * response in-flight can complete).<p>
     * 
     * Exceptions signalled to {@code Subscriber.onError()} that are not
     * <i>caused by</i> the subscriber itself can safely be assumed to indicate
     * low-level problems with the underlying channel. They will also have been
     * logged by the HTTP server followed suite by read-stream closure.<p>
     * 
     * Even if the server has a reaction for some observed exceptions - such as
     * closing the read stream as previously noted - this doesn't stop the
     * exception from being propagated as specified by {@link Publishers}.
