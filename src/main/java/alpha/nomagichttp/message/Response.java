/**
 * A {@code Response} contains a status line, followed by optional headers and
 * body.<p>
 * 
 * Can be built using a builder:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 *   // May use HttpConstants.StatusCode/ReasonPhrase instead of int and "string"
 *   Response r = Response.builder(204, "No Content")
 *                        .header("My-Header", "value")
 *                        .build();
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * {@code Response} is immutable but may be converted back into a builder for
 * templating. This effectively makes ready-built {@link Responses} also serve
 * as a repository of commonly used status lines. This example is equivalent to
 * the previous:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 *   Response r = Responses.noContent()
 *                         .toBuilder()
 *                         .header("My-Header", "value")
 *                         .build();
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * {@code Responses} in combination with body factories in {@link
 * BetterBodyPublishers} ought to cover for the most common use cases.
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 *   BodyPublisher body = BetterBodyPublishers.ofByteArray(...);
 *   Response r = Responses.ok(body); // 200 OK
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * The status line will be built by the server by joining the active HTTP
 * protocol version, status code and reason phrase. E.g. "HTTP/1.1 200 OK".<p>
 * 
 * The content of the response head (status line and headers) will be written
 * to the client verbatim/unaltered; i.e. casing will be preserved, yes, even
 * space characters. The head is encoded into bytes using {@link
 * StandardCharsets#US_ASCII US_ASCII} (UTF-8 is backwards compatible with
 * ASCII).<p>
 * 
 * When the headers are written on the wire, name and value will be concatenated
 * using a colon followed by a space (": "). Adding many values to the same
 * name replicates the header across multiple rows in the response. It does
 * <strong>not</strong> join the values on the same row. If this is desired,
 * first join multiple values and then pass it to the builder as one.<p>
 * 
 * Header order is not significant (
 * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2.2">RFC 7230 ยง3.2.2</a>
 * ), but will be preserved on the wire (FIFO) except for duplicated names which
 * will be grouped together and inserted at the occurrence of the first
 * value.<p>
 * 
 * The {@code Response} object can safely be reused sequentially over time to
 * the same client. The response can also be shared concurrently to different
 * clients, assuming the {@linkplain Builder#body(Flow.Publisher) body
 * publisher} is thread-safe. If the publisher instance was retrieved using any
 * method provided by the NoMagicHTTP library (e.g. {@link
 * BetterBodyPublishers}), then it is fully thread-safe and non-blocking. All
 * responses created by {@link Responses} that does not accept the body
 * publisher as an argument uses a thread-safe body publisher under the hood.<p>
 * 
 * The {@code Response} implementation does not necessarily implement {@code
 * hashCode()} and {@code equals()}.
