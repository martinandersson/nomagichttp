/**
 * Contains a status line, followed by optional headers, body and trailers.<p>
 * 
 * Can be built using a {@link Response.Builder}:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 *   // May use HttpConstants.StatusCode/ReasonPhrase instead of int and "string"
 *   Response r = Response.builder(204, "No Content")
 *                        .header("My-Header", "value")
 *                        .build();
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * The {@code Response} object is immutable, but the builder who built it can be
 * retrieved and used to create new responses derived from the first. This
 * effectively makes the {@link Responses} class a repository of commonly used
 * status lines.<p>
 * 
 * This example is equivalent to the previous:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 *   Response r = Responses.noContent().toBuilder()
 *                         .header("My-Header", "value")
 *                         .build();
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * {@code Responses} in combination with body factories in {@link
 * BetterBodyPublishers} ought to cover for the most common use cases.
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 *   BodyPublisher body = BetterBodyPublishers.ofByteArray(...);
 *   Response r = Responses.ok(body); // 200 OK
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * The content of the response head (status line and headers) will be written
 * to the client verbatim/unaltered; i.e. casing and white space will be
 * preserved.<p>
 * 
 * The {@code Response} object can safely be reused sequentially over time to
 * the same client. The response can also be shared concurrently to different
 * clients, assuming the {@linkplain Builder#body(Flow.Publisher) body
 * publisher} is thread-safe. If the publisher instance was retrieved using any
 * method provided by the NoMagicHTTP library (e.g. {@link
 * BetterBodyPublishers}), then it is fully thread-safe and non-blocking. All
 * responses with a body created by {@link Responses} that does not explicitly
 * accept a body publisher as an argument uses a thread-safe body publisher
 * under the hood.<p>
 * 
 * The {@code Response} implementation does not necessarily implement {@code
 * hashCode()} and {@code equals()}.
