/**
 * A {@code Response} contains a status line, followed by optional headers and
 * body.<p>
 * 
 * Can be built using a builder:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 *   Response r = Response.builder(204, "No Content") // Or use HttpConstants
 *                        .header("My-Header", "value")
 *                        .build();
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * {@code Response} is immutable but may be converted back into a builder for
 * templating. This example uses a factory from {@link Responses} and is
 * equivalent to the previous example:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 *   Response r = Responses.noContent()
 *                         .toBuilder()
 *                         .header("My-Header", "value")
 *                         .build();
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * {@code Responses} in combination with body factories in {@link
 * BetterBodyPublishers} ought to cover for the most common use cases.
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 *   BodyPublisher body = BetterBodyPublishers.ofByteArray(...);
 *   Response r = Responses.ok(body); // 200 OK
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * The status line will be built by the server by joining the active HTTP
 * protocol version, status code and reason phrase. E.g. "HTTP/1.1 200 OK".<p>
 * 
 * The content of the response head (status line and headers) will be written
 * to the client verbatim/unaltered; i.e. casing will be preserved, yes, even
 * space characters. The head is encoded into bytes using {@link
 * StandardCharsets#US_ASCII US_ASCII} (UTF-8 is backwards compatible with
 * ASCII).<p>
 * 
 * The {@code Response} object can safely be reused sequentially over time to
 * the same client. The response can also be shared concurrently to different
 * clients, assuming the {@linkplain Builder#body(Flow.Publisher) body
 * publisher} is thread-safe. If the publisher instance was retrieved using any
 * method provided by the NoMagicHTTP library, then it is thread-safe.<p>
 * 
 * The {@code Response} implementation does not necessarily implement {@code
 * hashCode()} and {@code equals()}.
