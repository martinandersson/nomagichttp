     * duration for each timer is the value returned from this method and is
     * polled at various points throughout the HTTP exchange.<p>
     * 
     * <strong>Request Timeout</strong><p>
     * 
     * A timeout while a request head is expected or in-flight will cause the
     * server to throw a {@link RequestHeadTimeoutException}, translated by the
     * {@link ErrorHandler#DEFAULT default error handler} to a 408 (Request
     * Timeout).<p>
     * 
     * If a request body is expected, then another timer will start as soon as
     * the request head parser terminates and ends when the request body
     * subscription terminates. When the timer elapses, a {@link
     * RequestBodyTimeoutException} is either thrown by the server or - if there
     * is a body subscriber - delivered to the subscriber's {@link
     * Flow.Subscriber#onError(Throwable) onError()} method. If it was thrown,
     * or the subscriber is the server's own discarding body subscriber, then
     * the error will pass through the error handler(s), the default of which
     * translates the exception to a 408 (Request Timeout).<p>
     * 
     * An application-installed body subscriber must deal with the timeout
     * exception (for example by responding {@link Responses#requestTimeout()}),
     * just as the application needs to be prepared to deal with any other error
     * passed to the body subscriber. Failure to deal with the exception, will
     * likely and eventually result in a {@link ResponseTimeoutException}
     * instead, as discussed in the next section.<p>
     * 
     * The request timers are not reset after each byte received on the wire.
     * The timers are only reset on each bytebuffer observed through the
     * processing chain. This means that an extremely slow client may cause a
     * request timeout even though the connection is technically still making
     * progress. Similarly, a request timeout may also happen because the
     * application's body subscriber takes too long processing a bytebuffer. It
     * can be argued that the purpose of the timeouts are not so much to protect
     * against stale connections as they are to protect against HTTP exchanges
     * not making progress, whoever is at fault.<p>
     * 
     * This coarse-grained resolution for timer reset is by design, as it
     * improves greatly the server performance and also works as an automatic
     * protection against slow clients hogging server connections.<p>
     * 
     * The in-practice minimum acceptable transfer rate can be calculated. The
     * default timeout duration is one and a half minute and the server's buffer
     * size is 16 384 bytes. This works out to a <i>possible</i> (dependent on
     * request size, and so on) timeout for clients sending data on average
     * equal to or slower than 1.456 kb/s (0.001456 Mbit/s) for one and a half
     * minute. This calculated minimum rate is well within the transfer rate of
     * cellular networks even older than 2G (10-15% of Cellular Digital Packet
     * Data rate). But if the application's clients are expected to be on Mars,
     * then perhaps the timeout ought to be increased.<p>
     * 
     * <strong>Response Timeout</strong><p>
     * 
     * Like the request timeout, different response timeouts are active at
     * various stages of the HTTP exchange. Unlike the request timeout, there's
     * only one exception type to be aware of: {@link ResponseTimeoutException}.
     * The outcome of the exception is dependent on where the exception
     * occurred.<p>
     * 
     * One response timer will timeout on failure of the application to deliver
     * a response to the {@link ClientChannel}. This timer starts when the
     * request timer(s) end or times out, and so the ClientChannel will never
     * timeout while a request is still actively being processed. The timer is
     * reset for each response given (after possible stage completion). A
     * response producer that needs more time can reset the timer by sending a
     * 1XX (Informational) interim response.<p>
     * 
     * Assuming that the write stream is still open when the exception occurs,
     * the ClientChannel's {@code ResponseTimeoutException} is delivered to the
     * error handler(s), the default of which translates it to a 503 (Service
     * Unavailable).<p>
     * 
     * A second response timer is active only when the server's response body
     * subscriber has outstanding demand and the timer is reset on each item
     * received. I.e. the application must not only ensure that response objects
     * are given to the ClientChannel in a timely manner but also that message
     * body bytes are emitted in a timely manner.<p>
     * 
     * Unlike the first timer discussed, a response body timeout will never be
     * delivered to the error handler(s). The exception will immediately
     * and forcefully close the channel.<p>
     * 
     * Analogous to the built-in protection against slow clients when receiving
     * data, a third response timer will cause the underlying channel write
     * operation to abort for response body bytebuffers not fully sent before
     * the duration elapses. This exception will also not be delivered to the
     * error handler(s). The application can chose to publish very large
     * response body bytebuffers without worrying about a possible timeout due
     * to the increased time it may take to send a large buffer. The server will
     * internally slice the buffer if need be.<p>
     * 
     * Any timeout exception not delivered to the exception handler(s) is
     * logged.<p>
     * 
     * Word of caution: There is currently no mechanism put in place to unblock
     * a stuck thread. For example, if the server's thread who subscribes to the
     * response body is immediately and indefinitely blocked, then no error
     * handler will ever be called and the timeout exception will never be
     * logged. The connection will close, but that's it. Never block a thread
     * from the server.<p>
