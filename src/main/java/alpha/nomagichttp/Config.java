     * size is 16 384 bytes. This works out to a possible (dependent on request
     * size, and so on) timeout for clients sending data on average equal to or
     * slower than 1.456 kb/s (0.001456 Mbit/s) for one and a half minute. This
     * calculated minimum rate is well within the transfer rate of cellular
     * networks even older than 2G (10-15% of Cellular Digital Packet Data
     * rate). But if the application's clients are expected to be on Mars, then
     * perhaps the timeout ought to be increased.<p>
     * 
     * If the application does not expect more requests and wishes to maintain
     * an outbound connection with the client used for interim responses
     * stretched over a long time or any other type of uni-directional
     * streaming, simply call {@link ClientChannel#shutdownInput()} which
