     * {@linkplain Responses#requestTimeout() 408 (Request Timeout)}.<p>
     * 
     * If the timeout occurs while there is an active request body subscriber,
     * it'll be delivered to the subscriber's {@code onError} method. If the
     * subscriber is the server's own discarding body subscriber, then the error
     * will be delivered to the error handler(s). An application-installed body
     * subscriber must deal with the timeout exception just as it needs to be
     * prepared to deal with any other error passed to the subscriber. Failure
     * to handle the exception will eventually result in a {@code
     * ResponseTimeoutException} instead.<p>
     * 
     * The timer is only reset once a read-buffer has filled up and a new read
     * operation is initiated. Therefore, an extremely slow client may cause a
     * read timeout even though the connection is technically still making
     * progress. Similarly, the timeout may also happen because the

     * can be argued that the purpose of the timeout is not so much to protect
     * against a stale connection but rather to protect against HTTP exchanges
     * not making progress, whoever is at fault.<p>

     * The minimum acceptable transfer rate can be calculated. The default
     * timeout duration is one and a half minute and the default server's buffer
     * size is 16 384 bytes. This works out to a possible (dependent on request
     * size, and so on) timeout for clients sending data on average equal to or
     * slower than 1.456 kb/s (0.001456 Mbit/s) for one and a half minute. This
     * calculated minimum rate is well within the transfer rate of cellular
     * networks even older than 2G (10-15% of Cellular Digital Packet Data
     * rate). But if the application's clients are expected to be on Mars, then
     * perhaps the timeout ought to be increased.<p>
     * 
     * If the application does not expect more requests and wishes to maintain
     * an outbound connection with the client used for interim responses
     * stretched over a long time or any other type of uni-directional
     * streaming, simply call {@link ClientChannel#shutdownInput()} which
