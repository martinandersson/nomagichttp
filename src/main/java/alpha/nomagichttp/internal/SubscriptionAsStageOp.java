     * Returns a stage that completes only when the downstream subscription
     * completes (through upstream completion/error or downstream cancellation)
     * <i>and</i> all published bytebuffers have been released.<p>
     * 
     * If the upstreams signals an error, then this exception instance will be
     * passed to the downstream subscriber and become the exception that
     * completes the stage returned from this method.<p>
     * 
     * If the downstream cancels the subscription, the returned stage completes
     * exceptionally with a {@link CancellationException}.<p>
     * 
     * There is obviously a race between signals coming in from the upstream and
     * asynchronous signals coming in from the downstream. This means there are
     * no guarantees that A) the upstream publisher immediately stops publishing
     * items after downstream cancellation - so buffers may be processed even
     * after the stage completes - and B) the stage completes in exactly the
     * same manner as agreed by both the upstream and downstream.<p>
     * 
     * In the context of the server's request thread, the cure for both A and B
     * is for the server to sandwich the stage-operator between an upstream
     * {@link LengthLimitedOp} and a downstream {@link OnCancelDiscardOp}. This
     * will ensure no trailing bytebuffers beyond the message boundary will be
     * published and it also completely takes out the cancellation signal from
     * the equation; the returned stage will only complete normally or
     * exceptionally as determined by the upstream.<p>
     * 
     * The stage may never complete if C) the application's subscriber never
     * arrives, or D) any terminating method that this class delegates to
     * ({@code Subscriber.onComplete} or {@code Subscription.cancel()}) returns
     * exceptionally.<p>
     * 
     * The cure for C is for the server to have a point in time when he gives up
     * waiting (documented in {@code Request.Body} to be the point when
     * the response-body subscription completes or on {@code
     * RequestBodyTimeoutException}). For this reason, the returned stage
     * supports being cast to a {@code CompletableFuture} (or do {@code
     * CompletionStage.toCompletableFuture()}) so that client code may complete
     * the stage or query about its state {@code CompletableFuture.isDone()}.<p>
     * 
     * D "should" never happen as the reactive streams specification mandates
     * that all methods should return normally (ยง2.13, ยง3.15). However, in the
     * event shit does hit the fan, the exception propagates as-is, eventually
     * reaching the top layer which on the server's side is a thread running
     * through the {@code ChannelByteBufferPublisher} which logs the error and
     * closes the channel's read stream. So as long as no thread is
     * <i>blocked</i> waiting on the returned stage, then a stage that never
     * completes is simply not a problem.
     *
